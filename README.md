# Summary -

The citibike program in New York City seems to be thriving based on a recent analysis of bike ridesharing data from August 2019. 
Among the 2 million rides, bike sharing is popular among male users where male riders percentage is 72.2%. 
We can see the most popular locations for start and end locations are the popular tourist area and peak hours which has similar pattern over weekdays and weekends.

The bike sharing is more popluar or higher number of rides for male population than females, this needs to be looked in with more data nalysis so that we can make this attractive to everyone irrespective of gender orientation.

Our goal is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. 
I believe we need to do some more data analysis before presenting our case for Des Moines.
